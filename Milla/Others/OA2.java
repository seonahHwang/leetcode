    * 	2. Array Burst Problem
Given an input length, String array and burst length(>0) as input,
* the output should be an array which is a shrunk input array such that the sequentially repeating elements more than or equal to burst length should be removed.
* This has to be repeated till the array cannot be shrunk any further.
* Use single characters in the string array for simplicity as shown in sample test cases.Sample case 1 :
Input :
